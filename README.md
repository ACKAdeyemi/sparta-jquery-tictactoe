###REVIEW
This task took a huge amount of time for me to complete as I tried and tried to experiment with my own ideas on how I might store and access data in a condensed way. In the end, I gave in and used a [solution that I came across online](https://coderbyte.com/tutorial/create-a-tic-tac-toe-game-using-html-css-and-jquery) for reference to solve the final pieces to this puzzle - of which were the win conditions. I edited the code to make it suit my needs and added comments to show my understanding. 

Overall I am pleased with this project as I managed to complete a majority of it by myself, I got try out a lot of experiments, I got **really** comfortable with the console.log() and I managed to get the task done in time for my deadline. Overall, an amazing challenge.
